### Meaning:

the practice of spying or of using spies, typically by governments to obtain political and military information.

### ¬†Are spies real?

Yes! Spies are real. Or the CIA wouldn't exist.

### Facts

1. The cameras in spy satellites have such powerful zoom, they can photograph licence plates clearly from 50 miles up in space.

2. The information spies stole was often so valuable that they faced death if found out. Some spies work like burglars to collect information. Others have access to information because other people trust them. When they betray trust, spies can win or lose wars, and even change the course of hisory.

3. Spies often need to write messages that cannot be understood by the enemy. They may use codes to replace letters with numbers or symbols, and cipher devices to make the message even more difficult to understand. Spies may even write messages with invisible ink or hide messages in pictures.

4\. Spies use special cameras to secretly take pictures of people, places, objects, or top-secret documents. Spies hide cameras under their clothing, and some wear special belts strapped to their body with the lens fitted behind a false button. They also carry cameras in bags or cases and take photographs through tiny openings. Other everyday objects, such as watches and pens, are designed to hold tiny cameras that spies use to take top-secret pictures.

5. The worst-kept secret in espionage may well be the British Secret Intelligence Service itself. James Bond, the most famous fictional spy ever, made her majesty's secret service a household phrase the world over, but the British government didn't officially acknowledge the agency's existence until 1994.

6\. George Koval was Soviet master spy that infiltrated the Manhattan project, stole nearly all of America's nuclear secrets, single-handedly provided the key technology for Russia's nuclear arsenal, and was only discovered as a spy in 2002.

7. In the 1960s, the CIA spent $20 million on a cat equipped to spy on Soviets, but it got hit by a taxi almost immediately after it was released for its first mission.
